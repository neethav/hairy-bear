There is a female black bear with 2 cubs roaming around the Allen/Martinsburg
area where my grandpa farms. A bunch of people have been seeing her and
the cubs. How would a female black bear make it here with 2 cubs? Where
the heck would she come from is my question?!? Especially with 2 cubs...i
guess shes been seen by a bunch of different people and theres pictures
of her and the cubs in alfalfa fields on facebooks that someone posted!
Is this crazy to anyone else? Mountain lions are EVERYWHERE around here
now, elks ranges are getting closer to here every year, my cousin was seeing
a bull elk by wisner everyday deer hunting last fall, and a couple years
ago a guy we hunt with found a moose skull by newcastle. Whats going on
cause this really doesnt seem 'normal' to me, especially for Nebraska.

Not sure if this classifies as hunting related but its interesting.
