The American black bear is the largest of the three bears species found
in North America, and are found only in North America. Black bears have
short, non-retractable claws that give them an excellent tree-climbing
ability.

Black bear fur is usually a uniform color except for a brown muzzle and
light markings that sometimes appear on their chests. Eastern populations
are usually black in color while western populations often show brown,
cinnamon, and blond coloration in addition to black. Black bears with white-bluish
fur are known as Kermode (glacier) bears and these unique color phases
are only found in coastal British Columbia, Canada.
