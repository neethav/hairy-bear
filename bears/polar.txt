A symbol of the Arctic, polar bears are the worldâ€™s largest land predator and biggest member of the bear family. With heavy fur, blubber up to four inches thick and black skin that absorbs heat from the sun, polar bears are amazingly well adapted to the Arctic climate. Denning females spend long periods of time largely immobile without eating or drinking, yet they do not lose bone mass or suffer from lack of water. Scientists believe that understanding polar bears may hold the key to treating many diseases.
