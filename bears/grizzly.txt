Grizzly bears are majestic symbols of the wild. Bears live in and use a
variety of habitat types, playing important roles in each one. This makes
them an “umbrella species,” meaning that when we protect them and their
habitat we also protect many species. Grizzly bears can also help ecosystems
by distributing seeds and nutrients through their scat, and occasionally
regulating ungulate populations.

Grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) have concave faces, a distinctive
hump on their shoulders, and long claws about two to four inches long.
Both the hump and the claws are traits associated with a grizzly bear’s
exceptional digging ability. Grizzlies are often dark brown, but can vary
from very light cream to black. The long guard hairs on their backs and
shoulders frequently have white tips and give the bears a "grizzled" appearance,
hence the name "grizzly." The correct scientific name for the species is
“brown bear,” but only coastal bears in Alaska and Canada are referred
to as such, while inland bears and those found in the lower 48 states are
called grizzly bears.
